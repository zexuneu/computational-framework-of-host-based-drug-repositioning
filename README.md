# computational-framework-of-host-based-drug-repositioning
Artificial intelligence-based algorithms have been applied in drug repositioning by predicting drug-target interactions in an efficient and high throughput manner. Precisely defining a druggable target gene set is another crucial factor affecting the success rate of drug repositioning. Here, we present a workflow of in silico drug repositioning for host-based antivirals using specially defined targets, refined list of drug candidates and easily implemented computational framework. Based on the framework, we have identified barticinib as the top anti-SARS-Cov-2 candidate, which has been validated in large clinical trials and has received emergency approval.
